WHAT IS THIS?

This is ProFont TrueType, converted to Windows TrueType format
by Mike Smith.

profontdoc.txt provides information about the original ProFont
distribution for Macintosh. I've added it to this archive, although
most of the information is not valid for this ProFont version.


VERSION NOTES

This is v2 of ProFontWindows.ttf.
Some text editors (VIM, MultiEdit) wouldn't use v1 because it wasn't
recognized as a monospaced font.
Thanks to Mark Anderson for fixing that problem.


ATARI NOTES

Atari systems use Windows TTF files (if NVDI is installed), but they
are quite strict about the internal format, so some TTF fonts
won't run.
In v1, I added a special Atari version of ProFont.
Obviously this is not needed anymore in v2.

If ProFontWindows.ttf does not run on your Atari System, try renaming
the file to match the "8+3" scheme (e.g. PROFONT.TTF).
